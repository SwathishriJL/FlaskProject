My name is Nithin Srivatsan. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University. During the summer of 2024, I completed a two-month internship at Wells Fargo under the CCIBT Line of Business (LOB), specifically within the CMT sub-LOB. During this period, I worked on a full stack project focused on cryptocurrency arbitrage trading, gaining hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development. I have also been offered a full-time employment (FTE) position along with a six-month winter internship
