I have never deployed any app before. Also our corporate system is a windows device. I'm just saying that we can deploy and host on our available Linux server

Deploying your first app can seem overwhelming, but deploying a Streamlit app to a corporate Linux server is quite feasible even if your main machine is Windows. The Linux server simply serves as the host—your development and initial testing can be done on Windows, and you can transfer files and run deployment steps remotely[1][2].

### Key Points for Beginners

- There’s no need to install Linux or dual-boot. Use SSH from Windows (with tools like PuTTY, MobaXterm, or Windows Terminal with SSH) to connect to your Linux server and perform deployment.
- The major work involves preparing your app on your Windows system, then transferring it (via SFTP/WinSCP/`scp`) to the Linux server, and running deployment commands there.
- All configuration, service setup, and security steps are performed remotely through command-line commands on the Linux server; your own device being Windows has no impact on the server setup[1].

### Step-by-Step: Windows to Linux Deployment Flow

1. **Develop & Test Locally:** Develop and test your Streamlit app on your Windows device.
2. **Prepare Dependencies:** Save your project code and a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies.
3. **Access the Linux Server:** Use SSH to connect to the Linux server.
4. **Transfer Files:** Use `scp` (via Windows Terminal or PowerShell), WinSCP, or another SFTP tool to copy your files to the Linux server.
5. **Follow Linux Deployment Steps:** Execute the commands (virtual environment setup, installing requirements, running Streamlit, optionally configuring Nginx/systemd) as described in the previous answer[1][2].
6. **Test the Deployment:** Once the server-side deployment is complete, access the web address as given to confirm it works as intended.

### Notes

- The choice to host on Linux is about robustness, security, and best practices for production—not about your development OS.
- If you ever need visual guidance: Look up “deploy Streamlit app on Linux server” tutorials with screenshots or video explanations for extra clarity[3][4].
- Ensure any credentials are not hard-coded in scripts; leverage `.env` files but with restricted permissions, or environment variables for improved security[1].

Even for a first-time deployer, this workflow is standard, and the process can be closely followed using guides and tutorials, making it approachable and low-risk for beginners[1][2].Deploying from a Windows workstation to a Linux server is a common workflow and fully supported—your personal device's OS does not restrict your deployment choices. You will prepare and test your Streamlit app on Windows, then transfer files and run deployment steps via SSH to the corporate Linux server[1][2].

To do this, connect to the Linux server using SSH from Windows (using free tools like PuTTY, Windows Terminal, or MobaXterm). Project files are transferred via SFTP (WinSCP or the scp command). All deployment and setup commands are then performed in the Linux environment, as described earlier. Your main tasks are preparing the app, securely moving it to the server, and then following the relevant Linux deployment steps. This approach is commonly used in both startups and large organizations, and requires no Linux installation on your Windows machine—just remote access to the target server[1][2].
