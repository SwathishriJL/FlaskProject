KT 7 Summary:
The seventh KT session focused on the TBH steps for DCP migration, where a detailed explanation was provided on how the TBH autosys components are migrated to the DCP (Deployment Control Platform). The session also included critical insights into TAS and NCS, particularly how the migration impacts these modules and how configurations need to be updated during this process. This session was essential in understanding the technical and functional shift when moving from legacy systems to a more modern deployment pipeline using DCP.

KT 8 Summary:
In the eighth KT session, the focus was entirely on TBH autosys and how to effectively troubleshoot using Splunk logs. The session covered how autosys jobs interact within the TBH ecosystem and gave a hands-on explanation on how to search logs, trace errors, and interpret logs to identify root causes. This training was highly beneficial for debugging, as it enhanced log analysis skills and helped the team gain confidence in identifying issues quickly through log monitoring.

KT 9 Summary:
The ninth KT session continued the focus on TBH autosys, providing in-depth technical details on its structure, scheduling mechanisms, and dependency handling. It also included a practical session on local setup, showing how to configure the environment for developing and testing TBH-related autosys jobs. The knowledge gained from this session helped deepen the understanding of how jobs are managed, triggered, and monitored within the system.

KT 10 Summary:
The tenth and final KT session revolved around the migration of TBH autosys jobs to DCP. This session highlighted how the autosys jobs were being shifted to the DCP framework, including the detailed steps involved in this migration. Special attention was given to the SIL file, explaining its significance in the migration process, how it stores configuration or job-related data, and the correct way to create and handle it during deployment. This session rounded off the series by bridging knowledge of job orchestration with platform modernization.
